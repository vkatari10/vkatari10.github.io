            <p>The SSRL has <b class="emp">developed advanced satellite buses and kits</b>, which are provided to high schools in the form of educational LEARNsat kits and the satellite bus itself. These kits offer students the unique opportunity to learn about satellite technology through <b class="emp">hands-on experience</b>. High school students, <b class="emp">guided by detailed instructions and educational materials</b>, are able to complete the assembly of the satellite bus on their own. This initiative aims to inspire and educate the next generation of engineers and scientists by offering practical exposure to space technology at an early stage in their academic careers.</p>
            <p>- <span class="red-word">Lowers</span> barriers to entering CubeSat technology</p>
            <p>- <span class="red-word">Lowers</span> costs for students</p>
            <p>- <span class="red-word">Lowers</span> technical requirements to manufacture buses</p>
            <h3 id="title-learn">Ease of Use</h3>
            <p>With specialized satellite buses and educational kits, which are provided to high schools as part of an innovative outreach program. These satellite buses, along with the comprehensive LEARNsat educational kits, are designed to <b class="emp">introduce students to the fundamentals of satellite technology and space engineering</b>. By following the detailed instructions and utilizing the resources included in these kits, <b class="emp">high school students are able to fully assemble the satellite bus themselves</b>. This hands-on experience not only enhances their understanding of complex scientific concepts but also encourages them to explore potential careers in the fields of aerospace and engineering. Through this initiative, SSRL aims to empower young learners with the practical skills and knowledge needed to succeed in the rapidly evolving space industry.</p>
            <h3 id="title-learn">Launch</h3>
  
            <p>Launched using weather balloons, this mission is designed to function as a suborbital mission, meaning it remains within Earth's atmosphere rather than traveling into space. By avoiding the complexities of space-bound launches, the entire process becomes <b class="emp">significantly more manageable and straightforward to execute</b>. This suborbital approach eliminates the need for advanced rocket systems and complex launch infrastructure, making the mission more cost-effective and less technically challenging. Additionally, the simplified process reduces the logistical and regulatory hurdles typically associated with space launches, allowing for a quicker and more accessible way to conduct scientific experiments, educational programs, or technology demonstrations at high altitudes. This approach <b class="emp">opens the door for a broader range of participants</b>, from schools to research institutions, to engage in near-space exploration without the high costs and risks involved in traditional space missions.</p>

to, which would otherwise be hard for high school students to meet.
LEARNSat-1 will be an internal mission so that we can map out all the
requirements and face logistical problems first before we invite high schools to
participate. This would allow for more STEM students in UGA to be involved in
CubeSat development and raise awareness of satellite technology in schools.
Additionally, as part of the funding we also have $2000 allocated to hosting a
competition for high schools to compete in with their research proposals, with
the best one being selected and given the funding to start developing their
project.

Current Target Customer: STEM-focused K-12 Educational Institutes (with
emphasis on magnet and private schools)

<!--
Build a basic website from scratch to advertise our newest mission, the LEARNSat program, using the tools of your own choosing.
We are not looking for a full-fledged website, but the purpose of this project is to challenge you with a large volume of work within 
a short period. We will be looking for functionality, technical expertise, creativity, and your ability to interpret information and 
display it effectively.

ADVERTISE the newest mission
LOOKING FOR functionality, techincal expertise, creativity, and the ability for me to interpret information and display it effectivley

I DO NOT have to display all the information I have the freedom to make creative assumptions and make changes to augment the website
 
Feel free to attach mock-ups and ideas along with your final project, but make sure to clarify which are which. Upon completion, 
please reply to this email with your final project, along with a description of what tools you used, no later than September 16th at 11:59 pm.
